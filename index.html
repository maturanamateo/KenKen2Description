    Project Started in May 2020. <a href = "https://www.kenkenpuzzle.com/"> kenkenpuzzle.com</a><br>
    <i>
        Update as of January 24th, 2021: Single-player has been completely implemented. Multi-player is now in development. Release date TBD.

<h2> User Interface </h2>
Below is the current user interface when the user chooses to solve a puzzle. This includes all the functions that you
would come to expect from a UI. <br>
<br>
<u> Board </u> <br>
To create the board, the frontend receives a KenKen JSON from the backend that is then interpreted by a function that
constructs the actual HTML board that you see. This board allows the user to input numbers and notes using the toolbar
or the keyboard. I have inputted a few numbers and notes as an example.
<i> Note: The board prevents the user from entering numbers outside the range of 1 <= x <= dimension. </i> <br>
<br>
<u> Toolbar </u>
<ul>
    <li>
        Normal/Notes: These buttons can be toggled based on whether the user wants to put notes in the grid or numbers.
        Only one can be selected at once.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keypad: The keypad can be used instead of the keyboard to input numbers or notes. Only numbers between 1 and the
        dimension of the puzzle appear on the puzzle because these are the only valid numbers in the puzzle.
    </li>
    <li>
        Delete: Deletes all elements of a selected cell (can select a cell by clicking on it, confirmation when highlighted).
    </li>
    <li>
        Restart: Resets all progress (does not restart the timer). Prompts a confirmation popup.
    </li>
</ul>
<u> Buttons </u>
<ul>
    <li>
        Flag: Flag is only present in single-player. The purpose of flag is so that users can flag a puzzle that has any
        issues (multiple solutions for example) before they are added to the competitive multiplayer pool.
    </li>
    <li>
        Submit: When clicked, provides feedback based on accuracy, speed, and compares you to your opponent if in
        multiplayer.
    </li>
    <li>
        New Puzzle: Prompts a popup where users can select a new puzzle.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2> KenKen Generation </h2>
Our KenKen database is filled with our own generated puzzles. There are three components to this generation: Latin Square
Generation, Cage Generation, Operation Generaion. Together, these three create a random KenKen. <br>
<br>
<u> Latin Square Generation </u> <br>
As a reminder, a latin square is a square of size x such that each number 1 - x appears exactly once in each column and
row. Given dimension x, we first randomly sort a list of numbers from 1 to x. I'll use 6 as an example for the remainder
of this section, but the process is the same for any dimension. <br>
<br>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
</table> <br>
Then, we fill in each subsequent row of the board with an offset of 1 to ensure that we create a Latin Square in the
process. <br>
<br>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td>
    </tr>
</table> <br>
Observe that if we switch any two rows or columns, we are still left with a latin square. Therefore our next step is
to randomly swap rows and columns. This then leaves us with a random latin square like the one below. <br>
<br>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>6</td>
    </tr>
</table> <br>
<u> Cage and Operation Generation </u> <br>
To generate cages, we start in the top left corner of the grid, then randomly "snake" until the snake has nowhere to move.
We then restart the snake at a random point then repeat the process. The snakes are then partitioned based on
predetermined distributions and these partitions are the cages. For each cage, an operation is generated based on a set
distribution. These distributions are chosen whether subtraction and/or division is valid for a cage (addition and
multiplication are always valid).
